# Context (GBM/HGG vs LGG)

-  Low grade glioma (LGG):
    - 199 cases
    - Better prognosis

-  High grade glioma (HGG):
    - 262 cases
    - Poor prognosis
    - Typically do not have clear edges and have a heterogenous appearance

![Fig.1: Glioma sub-regions. The whole tumor (yellow) visible in T2-FLAIR (Fig.A), the tumor core (red) visible in T2 (Fig.B), the enhancing tumor structures (light blue) visible in T1Gd, surrounding the cystic/necrotic components of the core (green) (Fig. C). The segmentations are combined to generate the final labels of the tumor sub-regions (Fig.D): edema (yellow), non-enhancing solid core (red), necrotic/cystic core (green), enhancing core (blue).

# DATA (Hospitals)

- Images acquired with different clinical protocols and various scanners from multiple (n=13) institutions:
    - The native (T1)
    - Post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd)
    - T2-weighted (T2)
    - T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)
- However, there is a large database from TCIA:
    - 102 HGG cases
    - 65 HGG cases

# Training I
    - Train a TCIA-based CNN
    - Reuse convolutional layers to train a "semantic" CNN with non-TCIA data
    - Reuse previous weights to classify non-TCIA data
